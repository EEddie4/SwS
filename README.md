# Sight Word Sidekick
Mobile (Android) educational game developed using Unity and C#.
## Description from Google Play Store
Learn up to 1,000 common words to make both reading and writing fun, faster, and easier. 

Sight Word Sidekick is designed for children ages 0-12.

In a very simple way, Sight Word Sidekick is organized into 10 levels with 100 words in each level. For each word, you can read it, and you can hear it pronounced by Kristie Opfer, a credentialed teacher from California.

Simply select a level, and use the blue left and right arrows to change words. To hear the word pronounced, simply press the orange audio button near the bottom of the screen. When you are ready to change levels, you can press the red back arrow button in the top-right corner.

Happy learning!
